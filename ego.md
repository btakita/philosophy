The ego is the being's definition of self. The notion of self from the perspective of the being.

It is also the cause to impose one's reality onto another being.

If the ego is given too much energy and used to commit violence (physical, spiritual, emotional, etc), then it can be a bad thing. The ego can be the motivating factor for a being to suppress another being. e.g., My ego prevents me from admitting that I am wrong so I will make someone else wrong.

However, the ego is not always bad. The ego can be a defensive measure to protect the being against another being imposing an illusion (via brainwashing or other coercive techniques).
