## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

All [perspectives](./perspective.md) have a scope.

Since scope of this Philosophy is [Existence](./existence.md)/[God](./god.md), the [resolution](./resolution.md) starts low. <a href="http://cosmicscale.appspot.com/index.html" target="_blank">
The Cosmic Scale</a> is a demonstration of scope (at different scales) in the [physical universe](./src/physical-system.md).

This philosophy defines [abstractions](./abstraction.md) in relation to Existence. Words, when applied to narrower scopes (than Existence), have different meanings. It is a [tool](./tool.md) that provides [awareness](./src/awareness.md) & degrees of freedom to create [systems](./system.md) with various scopes.

[Human](./src/human.md) [Beings](./src/being.md) can [focus](./src/focus.md) on a finite amount of complexity which is much less than the scope of Existence. This means humans must utilize abstractions to create systems that can be [focused](./focus.md) upon, lest the human becomes overwhelmed and not effective.

You can zoom in & out of the [system](./system.md) to observe details & [patterns](./src/pattern.md).
