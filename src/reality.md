# Reality

[Reality - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality)

The interpretation of [Existence](./existence.md) from a [soul's](./soul.md) perspective. The Information may be Consciously or Unconsciously experienced.

A social group entity has a reality based on it's perspective. The social group's perspective is based on the perspective of the members, with explicitly & implicitly agreed upon definitions.

An entity can impose it's reality upon another entity.

In modern culture, Reality is often used to refer to "The state of things as they actually exist, rather than as they may appear or might be imagined".

In this philosophy, any entity has a perspective and a reality.

e.g. A rock does not have a nervous system or much of a dynamic intelligence. It's reality is more singular

Being Aware of other Realities has the quality to allows a Soul to live within that particular Reality.

## Singular Reality

An absolute view of Existence. From the perspective, Existence cannot be any other way.

## Plural Reality

A Reality that accepts the existence of and can incorporate other Realities.

## Objective Reality

Reality from the Perspective of a Higher Being.
