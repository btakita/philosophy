Existence is God {
  This is an attempt to define a spiritual system with culturally true definitions. {
    This is intended to be a living iterative document meant to interact with current culture.
    Discussion is encouraged. The language is self-referential.
  }
  All definitions apply to the definitions in this document. {
    Each section within this document is an Entity.

  }
  Document Resolution {
    Root Meaning of the three terms (This definition is inspired by the similarity of their root lower resolutions.) {
      The nature of Information means it is a System and is a Soul.
      
    }
    Intention of Resolution { The intention of being at a lower resolution is to highlight the sameness of these terms. }
    At higher Conceptual Resolutions { Information, System, & Soul have nuanced & different meanings. }
  }
  Existence/God {
    Everything that "is", or more simply, everything (Physical, Conceptual, Social, Spirit). The overarching System.
    Entity {
      God is an Entity.    
    
    }
  }
  Information/Entity/System/Being/Soul/Culture/Philosophy/Religion {
    That which can distinguish one thing from another.
    Information which exhibits intelligence.
    Entity { "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity" }
    System {
      Physical System { "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system" }
      Conceptual System { "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_system" }
    }
    Soul { "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul"
      A Soul is a Being.
      Animism { "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism"
        I favor Animism''s view of Soul.
        It is defined by primitive humans, had an undistilled perspective.
        Their view of souls recognizes the nature of intelligence in it''s primitive forms.
        Example { Non-biological entities (such as rivers and mountains) possess souls. }
        Cultural Ego {
          My view is the Story of Animism is: {
            Animism is an earlier state of common worldview that has been opposed contemporary culture. {
              The 1819 view of culture with the Amimism philosophy 
              
            }

        }

    }
    Being { "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being" }
  }
  Evolution {
    The Iteration of design of an Entity based on feedback from Reality.
    This Iteration can happen over Time or in a progression of steps.
    If you think of Time as a progression of steps, like film, then the progression is the same.
  }
  Higher Being {
    A Being that is more Evolved than another Being.
    Evolved {
      Progressed and closer to God in a Systemic sense. { The System has a variable Resolution. }
    
    }
  }
  Intelligence {
    The cause/effect system of the Soul.
    It also include control logic, Information transfer, Evolution.
    Human-like Intelligence {
      logic, abstract thought, understanding, self-awareness, communication, learning, emotional knowledge, memory, planning, and problem solving.
      
    }
  }
  State {
    The status of Information.
      
  }
  Time { "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"
    The sequence of States in Reality.
    See "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4Gotl9vRGs"
  }
  Pattern {
    The elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable or regular manner.
    Any of the five traditionally accepted senses may directly observe patterns.
    Abstract patterns in science, spirit, mathematics, or language require conceptual & extrasensory senses.
  }
  Direct Observation {
    Observation by a person of a System or Event from one or more of their senses.
    Socially Accepted Senses {
      A Collective''s definition of Direct Observation, is Observation using one or more Socially Accepted Senses.
      Socially Accepted Senses differ according to the Perspective of the Reality it is in.
    }
    These observations are widespread in nature and in art.
  }
  Energy {
    Energy is a property of objects, transferable among them via fundamental interactions, which can be converted in form but not created or destroyed.
    The ability of a system (physical/conceptual) to do work on other systems (physical/conceptual)
  }
  Spirit {
    The motivation of the soul in it''s current state.
    The Holy Spirit causes people to vibrate at a higher level and perform actions with increased zeal.
    The Spirit of Greed causes one to act in greedy ways.
  }
  Reality {
    Plural { Realities }
    The interpretation of existence from a soul''s perspective. The Information may be Consciously or Unconsciously experienced.
    Reality can be seen as being singular (absolute), or being plural (relative).
    e.g. A rock does not have a nervous system or much of a dynamic intelligence. It''s reality is more singular  
    Reality can be socially defined 
    Can be used to enforce one''s reality to another.
    Often user to refer to a, The state of things as they actually exist, rather than as they may appear or might be imagined
    Singular Reality {
      An absolute view of Existence. From the perspective, Existence cannot be any other way.
      
    }
    Plural Reality {
      A Reality that accepts the existence of and can incorporate other Realities.
      
    }
    Objective Reality {
      Reality from the Perspective of a Higher Being.

    }
    Being Aware of other Realities has the quality to allows a Soul to live within that particular Reality.
  }
  Perspective/Abstraction {
    The view of reality from a soul''s point of view
    Abstraction {
      The view of reality from a Model''s point of view
      Characteristic Traits {
        Abstraction is:
        * to take a distance from the physical world
        * (or is a close to) generalization
        * information hiding
        * to keep only relevant aspects
        * a kind of reformulation or approximation
        * a to change levels of detail
      }
      Model { The Characteristic Traits of abstraction can then be used to build up a Model. }

    }
  }
  Resolution {
    The detail & scope of the perspective.
    Detail is increased with iteration & meditation.
    A broad perspective on a system usually means a low resolution to be consciously aware of the information.
    One can focus perspective to gain a higher resolution.
    You can zoom in & out of the system to observe details & patterns.
    Fractal {
      Resolution is increased when zooming into a Fractal.
      Resolution is decreased when zooming out of a Fractal.
    }
    First Order Resolution {
      Does not include another Resolution.
      
    }
    Second Order Resolution {
      A Resolution that consists of multiple Resolutions.
      Often not distinguished by a Resolution, thus seen as a property of a common Resolution. Like a path through Resolutions.
    }
    Scale Confusion {
      A skewed projection of an Object/Concept in a different Resolution based on the current Resolution.

    }
  }
  Story/History/Herstory {
    Recounting of a sequence of events/Narrative {
      A Story is algorithmic.
      It is often of a low resolution, thus requiring little information to communicate (or transfer) a Conceptual System.
      It can be iterated upon to create more resolution.
    }
  }
  Tool {
    Conceptual or Physical System that is used to create a desired effect on another System or itself.

  }
  Fractal {
    A curve or geometric figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole.
    Fractals are useful in modeling structures (such as eroded coastlines or snowflakes) in which similar patterns: {
      Recur at progressively smaller scales
      In describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as: {
        Crystal growth
        Fluid turbulence
        Galaxy formation
      }
    }
  }
  Rules {
    
    
  }
  Idolatry { "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry"
    The definition of God as an Entity less than (a part of) Existence.
    
  }
  Oneness {
    The initial State of Existence.
    We used to all be one Being and Fully Conscious of it.
    The Physical expression of Oneness is The Singularity?
  }
  Fully Conscious {
    Fully experiencing the full State of a Being.
    Right at this moment, I am a Fully Conscious version of Brian Takita''s present Consciousness.
    Often used to relate to Enlightenment. Fully Conscious with a Higher Form.
  }
  Concrescence {
    A local state of unusually high complexity.

  }
}
Notes {
  All human conceptual experience into one cohesive whole.
  Technology, Culture, & Spiritual
  These days, our fundamental notions of existence, God is Evolves over Time.
