## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

The ego is the [being's](./being.md) definition of self. The notion of self from the [perspective](./perspective.md) of the being.

It is also the cause to impose one's reality onto another being.

If the ego is given too much [energy](./energy.md) and used to commit violence (physical, spiritual, emotional, etc), then it can be considered undesirable. The ego can be the motivating factor for a being to suppress another being. e.g., My ego prevents me from admitting that I am wrong so I will make someone else wrong.

However, the ego is not always considered undesirable. The ego can be a defensive measure to protect the being against another being imposing an [illusion](./illusion.md) (via brainwashing or other coercive techniques).
