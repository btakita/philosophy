# This Philosophy

This [philosophy](./philosophy.md) takes an approach focusing on the [definitions of words](definition-based-philosophy.md) (aka [abstractions](./abstraction.md)) to create a [model](./model.md) of [Existence](./existence.md) (or [God](./god.md)) that works in any [context](./context.md). This philosophy also [heuristically](./heuristic.md) unifies all [scopes](./scope.md) in Existence by allowing context to be applied to each abstraction.

## The [Story](./story.md) of this philosophy

The root premise came from God is Existence and Existence is God. This enables the re-merging of [spirituality](./spirituality.md) and [science](./science.md) in the current [cultural](./culture.md) [context](./context.md). This enables spiritual works to be evaluated from the perspective of the author(s) and reinterpreted in a universal way. [Awareness](./awareness.md) of spirituality, science, culture, [art](./art.md), [technology](./technology.md), and any other [entity](entity.md) ([physical](./physical-system.md) or [conceptual](conceptual-system.md)) contribute to [expanding consciousness](./expanding-consciousness.md).

This philosophy uses [Domain Driven Design](./domain-driven-design.md) and is influenced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Growing a Language by Guy Steele - youtube.com</a>.

## This philosophy & the Tradition Story

This philosophy does not explicitly follow any existing philosophical [tradition](./tradition.md). While there are influences from other philosophical traditions, this philosophy is not constrained by those traditions.

This philosophy seeks to be a model which is not limited in the context of Existence. All words represent all contextual meanings within existence or there is another word that represents a better or more correct abstraction. This philosophy also exposes redundancy with some words as the words evolve from different philosophical or cultural traditions.

This philosophy was originally developed in parallel to & now utilizes [Attention Schema](./attention-schema.md) from Dr. Michael Graziano's Attention Schema Theory. This philosophy also utilizes knowledge & concepts from many other philosophical, spiritual, scientific, & trade works.
