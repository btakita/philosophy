A Soul is an [entity's](./entity.md) meta entity. It is the [system](./system.md) that determines how an entity acts, thinks, feels, etc. Related to [Intelligence](./intelligence.md).

There is also a notion of timelessness or dimensionality beyond three dimensional space. Similar to an entity's [spiritual](./spirituality.md) journey through time.

When [souls](./soul.md) connect, there's a notion of co-[evolution](./evolution.md) between the souls.

## [Animism](./animism.md)

> the worldview that non-human entities (animals, plants, and inanimate objects or phenomena) possess a spiritual essence

[This philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) utilizes Animism's assertion that all Entities have Soul.
