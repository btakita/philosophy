# Soul

[Soul - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul)

A Soul is an [entity's](./entity.md) meta entity. It is the system that determines how an entity acts, thinks, feels, etc. Related to [Intelligence](./intelligence.md).

There is also a notion of timelessness or dimensionality beyond three dimensional space. Similar to an entity's spiritual journey through time.

When souls connect, there's a notion of co-[evolution](./evolution.md) between the souls.
