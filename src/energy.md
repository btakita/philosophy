## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

Energy is a property of objects, transferable among them via fundamental interactions, which can be converted in form but not created or destroyed. The ability of a [system](./system.md) ([physical](./physical-system.md)/[conceptual](./conceptual-system.md)) to do work on other systems (physical/conceptual).

### Conceptual Energy

Energy in a [conceptual system](./conceptual-system.md). An example is the energy in a model of a [physical system](./physical-system.md).

Conceptual Energy can be [expanded](./expanding-consciousness.md) to mean attention energy applied to an abstraction in a conceptual system. For example, Jesus has plenty of conceptual energy in Christianity because much attention energy is applied to the abstraction Jesus.
