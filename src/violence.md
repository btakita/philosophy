## [Cultural](./culture.md) Definition

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence" target="_blank">Violence (Wikipedia)</a>

> The World Health Organization defines violence as "the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation", but acknowledges that the inclusion of "the use of power" in its definition expands on the conventional meaning of the word. This definition associates intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is turbulent or excited in an injurious, damaging or destructive way, or presenting risk accordingly, may be described as violent or as occurring violently, even if not signifying violence (by a person and against a person).
