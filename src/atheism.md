# Atheism

## [Ontology](./ontology.md)

Non-[belief](./belief.md) in [God](./god.md); God does not [exist](./exist.md) in an atheist's [philosophy](./philosophy.md). Note that atheism is not a philosophy in itself.

## [Axiology](./axiology.md)

This philosophy sees everything existing in the [scope](./scope.md) of [Existence](./existence.md), so the notion that [God](./god.md) does not "exist" is false by definition, since Existence is God.

This philosophy is influenced by atheism where [natural law](./natural-law.md) explains all phenomena in Existence.
