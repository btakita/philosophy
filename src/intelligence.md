# Intelligence

[Intelligence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence)

This philosophy expands the traditional scope of Intelligence to mean the [control system](./control-system.md) of an [entity](./entity.md). Since entity's include inanimate objects (i.e. rocks) or concepts, inanimate objects and concepts have intelligence.

## Human Intelligence

In humans, the scope of Intelligence goes beyond the mind to relate to emotions, cellular intelligence, cellular group intelligence, etc.

## Group Intelligence

Entities also include groups of people, so a community, a nation, an organization, etc. has intelligence.

## Inanimate Object Inanimate

The intelligence (control system) of a rock (hardness, elasticity, density, mass, etc.) are determined by the rock's chemical composition, shape, crystallinity, environment, etc.

## Conceptual Intelligence

A concept has intelligence as it relates to another entity. For example, a person focusing on a concept is effected by the concept in certain ways.

Concepts also have effects on other concepts. For example, saying "this philosophy will evolve" combines the intelligence of this philosophy to the intelligence of [evolution](./evolution.md). The phrase imparts a notion that this philosophy is under a process of evolution, adding to the meaning of the abstraction of and the controlling characteristics of "this philosophy".
