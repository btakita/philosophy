> The supernatural (Medieval Latin: supernātūrālis: supra "above" + naturalis "nature", first used: 1520–30 AD) is that which is not subject to the laws of physics or, more figuratively, that which is said to exist above and beyond nature. In philosophy, popular culture and fiction, the supernatural is associated with the paranormal, religions and occultism. It has neoplatonic and medieval scholastic[4] origins.

Supernatural is the [belief](./belief.md) of [physical](physical-system.md) & [conceptual](./conceptual-system.md) phenomena not being subject to [natural law](./natural-law.md).

By definition, natural law explains all phenomena and supernatural phenomena do not occur. Instead, something may be deemed supernatural when the observer does not understand, or wishes to abstract, the underlying natural laws of the phenomena.
