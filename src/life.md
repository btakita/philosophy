## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

This philosophy removes the distinction of "physical" [entities](./entity.md). Life is an entity that is self-sustaining and can emit & receive [signals](./signal.md) and is [self-sustaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sustainability).

Biological life is commonly used as the [definition](./definition.md) of Life. This philosophy expands the meaning of Life to include [abstract](./abstract.md) & "inanimate" physical matter. [Abstract](./abstract.md) & inanimate matter have signaling (input/output) & are self-sustaining.
