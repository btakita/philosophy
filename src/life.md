<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life" target="_blank">Life (Wikipedia)</a>

> Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having signaling and self-sustaining processes from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (death), or because they lack such functions and are classified as inanimate.

> A system is self-sustaining (or self-sufficient) if it can maintain itself by independent effort. The system self-sustainability is:

> 1. the degree at which the system can sustain itself without external support
> 1. the fraction of time in which the system is self-sustaining

## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

This philosophy removes the distinction of "physical" [entities](./entity.md). Life is an entity that can [signal](./signal.md) (e.g. through [input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output)) and is [self-sustaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sustainability).

Biological life is commonly used as the definition of Life. This philosophy expands the meaning of Life to include [abstract](./abstract.md) & "inanimate" physical matter. [Abstract](./abstract.md) & inanimate matter have signaling (input/output) & are self-sustaining.
