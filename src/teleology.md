> A teleology (from Ancient Greek telos, meaning roughly "end" or "purpose",[1] and -logia, meaning "study of, discourse") is an account of a given thing's end or purpose. For instance, we might give a teleological account of why forks have prongs by showing their purposeâ€”how the design helps humans to eat certain foods. Stabbing food and helping humans eat is what forks are for.

Teleology is useful for [creative](./create.md) & [evolutionary](./evolution.md) processes with design intent. A danger of teleology is reduced freedom of movement by becoming fixated on a particular goal when unexplored alternatives exist. To counter this danger, one can be open to discovering [patterns](./pattern.md) of the design intents & to revise the design intents.

[Abstract](./abstraction.md) [systems](./conceptual-system.md) often utilize Teleology to achieve the goals of [pattern](./pattern.md) expression.

Teleology is often not a desired trait for present moment [observation](./observe.md) because bias & [judgement](./judgement.md) are introduced to fit the observations into a [narrative](./story.md). However, teleology may be useful to create an evolutionary model with design goals, to demonstrate creative reasoning or growth of a phenomena.
