In [this philosophy](./this-philosophy.md), precision relates to the the detail of the statement describing the [reality](./reality.md). One can go into precise detail about the sequence of events or one can give a one-word description. Precision is lost when one uses [abstraction](./abstraction.md).

As a [heuristic](./heuristic.md), less precise abstractions allows an [entity](./entity.md) to focus on a greater [conceptual](conceptual-system.md) [scope](./scope.md).
