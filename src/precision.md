Relates to [accuracy](./accuracy.md).

[Accuracy and Precision - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision)

> precision of a measurement system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results

In [this philosophy](./this-philosophy.md), precision relates to the the detail of the statement describing the reality. One can go into precise detail about the sequence of events or one can give a one-word description. Precision is lost when one uses [abstraction](./abstraction.md).

As a heuristic, less precise abstractions allows an [entity](./entity.md) to focus on a greater conceptual scope.
