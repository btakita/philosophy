## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

This Philosophy redefines words to expand or contract the consciousness of the [entity](./entity.md). A redefinition can [expand consciousness](./expanding-consciousness.md) by expanding the [scope](./scope.md) of the meaning while keeping a connection to the more [precise](./precision.md) & narrower scoped meaning.

One can [focus](./focus.md) on the "[spirit](./spirit.md)" of the word in the modern [context](./context.md). Intending to increase the relevancy of words and shed the historical inaccuracies that the words have accumulated and expanding overly narrow scopes.

Redefinition of words can also contract consciousness of an [entity](./entity.md) by causing focus to occur on an inaccurate meaning or a narrower scope of the word. An example of this occurring is a marketing or news entity redefining a word to have a meaning specific to a product, causing members of the public to "forget" the broader meaning.

Words are [patterns](./pattern.md) that can be applied to multiple contexts. For example, God has different meanings across different [belief](./belief.md) [systems](./system.md) since the [definition](./definition.md) of God varies across these belief systems. [This philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) defines God as being Existence, thus being everything.

Word definitions influence thoughts and symbolic [abstractions](./abstraction.md) that an entity relates with. One can be grounded with culturally defined terminology to effectively communicate within the cultural context. However, one can expand the consciousness of the culture, by expanding the scope of the words.

Here are some arguments against redefinitions.

There may be confusion caused from redefinition. This philosophy seeks to make these redefinitions explicit & make the audience aware of these redefinitions. Inspiring thought of the implications of these redefinitions help the audience think of Existence with a new perspective.

### Scope & Precision

A challenge of word definitions are the ambiguity of Scope & [Precision](./precision.md). Definitions vary in ambiguity. The Scope & Precision can be altered to apply to more or less [domains](./domain.md) when redefining a word.

Broadening the scope of words, so it applies to more domains, allows analogies to apply to the sentence where the word is used. Compound words, qualifying words, and sentence context can be used to narrow the scope of the word's definition.

[Expanding consciousness](./expanding-consciousness.md), like expanding space-time, tends coincidentally involve the constituent parts expanding. This means the scope of definitions tend to expand as consciousness expands. When communicating a precise meaning, context is applied to the definition.

A being with a consistent & unified consciousness can use a similar [attention schema](./attention-schema.md) across multiple contexts. If the being can efficiently isolate the scope, precision, & [accuracy](./accuracy.md) of the optimal attention schema based on the context, then the being can effectively isolate the optimal definitions to think & express optimal meaning.

A being can learn by efficiently expanding consciousness. Expanding consciousness, via the attention schema, involves learning new terminology, expanding the scope of existing terminology, and increasing effectiveness of the precision context of the existing terminology.

### Precision Context

The Precision Context involves creating the precise Attention Schema by using contextual clues, qualifying words, and compound words. The precise Attention Schema is zoomed in to provide precise detail & expanded differentiation across the Attention Schema.
