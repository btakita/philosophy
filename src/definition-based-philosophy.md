# Definition Based Philosophy

[This philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) focuses on defining words as [abstractions](./abstraction.md). A [being](./being.md) can utilize these abstractions as a [tool](./tool.md) to create a [model](./model.md) or [reality](./reality.md) derived from [Existence](./existence.md).
