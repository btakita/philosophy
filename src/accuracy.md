# Accuracy

## [Ontology](./ontology.md)

The accuracy of an [abstraction](./abstraction.md) relates to the aspects that the abstraction is true to the target [concept](./concept.md) it describes. If there are [contradictions](./paradox.md) between the abstraction and the [reality](./reality.md) of the target concept, then the description is not accurate. If everything from the description is true to the reality of the target concept, then the description is accurate.
