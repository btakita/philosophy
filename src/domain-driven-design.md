> Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model. The premise of domain-driven design is the following:

> * Placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic.
  * Basing complex designs on a model of the domain.
  * Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
