> Everything that 'is', or more simply, everything

In [this philosophy](./this-philosophy.md), existence is [God](./god.md). Existence is the [Universal Set](./universal-set.md) of everything, including itself. Hence Existence exists, or it contained within the set of Existence.

In this philosophy, contrary to some [cultural](./culture.md) definitions, existence includes all thoughts & [states](./state.md) by all [entities](./entity.md). That means something that somebody makes up exists since it was created by an entity. This allows works of [art](./art.md), thoughts, feelings, temporary creations, etc. to exist without question or judgement. There is no need for physical manifestation, popular opinion, etc.

This definition of existence also serves as an abstraction of everything. A narrower [scoped](./scope.md) definition of existence leaves the [concept](./concept.md) without a word, thus without a named [abstraction](./abstraction.md).
