> Everything that 'is', or more simply, everything

## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

Existence is [God](./god.md). Existence is the [Universal Set](./universal-set.md) of everything, including itself. Hence Existence exists, or it contained within the set of Existence.

Contrary to some [cultural](./culture.md) definitions, existence includes all thoughts & [states](./state.md) by all [entities](./entity.md). That means something that somebody makes up exists since it was created by an entity. This allows works of [art](./art.md), thoughts, feelings, temporary creations, etc. to exist without question or judgement. There is no need for physical manifestation, popular opinion, etc.

### [Scoping](./scope.md) Existence

This definition of Existence also serves as an abstraction of everything. A narrower scoped definition of "Existence" leaves the [concept](./concept.md) without a word, thus without a named [abstraction](./abstraction.md).

Existence can be [contextually](./context.md) scoped, with a qualifying word. For example, Physical Existence means all physical phenomena. Conceptual Existence means all concepts. Mathematical Existence means all mathematical concepts. [Story](./story.md) Existence means all entities within the story.
