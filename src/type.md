> In disciplines such as logic, metalogic, typography, and computer programming, the type–token distinction is a distinction that separates a concept from the objects which are particular instances of the concept. For example, the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage" refers to a token of the type of thing known as "the bicycle", while the sentence "The bicycle has become more popular recently" refers to the type.

> In mathematics, logic, and computer science, a type theory is any of a class of formal systems, some of which can serve as alternatives to set theory as a foundation for all mathematics. In type theory, every "term" has a "type" and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type.

> Type theory is closely related to (and in some cases overlaps with) type systems, which are a programming language feature used to reduce bugs. The types of type theory were created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal logics and rewrite systems and sometimes "type theory" is used to refer to this broader application.
