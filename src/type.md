> (biology) An individual considered representative of members of its taxonomic group. "the type of a genus, family, etc."

> Preferred sort of person; sort of person that one is attracted to. "We can't get along: he's just not my type." "He was exactly her type."

> (biology) A blood group.

> (theology) An event or person that prefigures or foreshadows a later event - commonly an Old Testament event linked to Christian times.

> (computing theory) A tag attached to variables and values used in determining which kinds of value can be used in which situations; a data type.

> (fine arts) The original object, or class of objects, scene, face, or conception, which becomes the subject of a copy; especially, the design on the face of a medal or a coin.

> (chemistry) A simple compound, used as a mode or pattern to which other compounds are conveniently regarded as being related, and from which they may be actually or theoretically derived. "The fundamental types used to express the simplest and most essential chemical relations are hydrochloric acid, water, ammonia, and methane."

> (mathematics) A part of the partition of the object domain of a logical theory (which due to the existence of such partition, would be called a typed theory). (Note: this corresponds to the notion of "data type" in computing theory.) "Categorial grammar is like a combination of context-free grammar and types."

> In disciplines such as logic, metalogic, typography, and computer programming, the type–token distinction is a distinction that separates a concept from the objects which are particular instances of the concept. For example, the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage" refers to a token of the type of thing known as "the bicycle", while the sentence "The bicycle has become more popular recently" refers to the type.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory" target="_blank">Type Theory (Wikipedia)</a>

> In mathematics, logic, and computer science, a type theory is any of a class of formal systems, some of which can serve as alternatives to set theory as a foundation for all mathematics. In type theory, every "term" has a "type" and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type.

> Type theory is closely related to (and in some cases overlaps with) type systems, which are a programming language feature used to reduce bugs. The types of type theory were created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal logics and rewrite systems and sometimes "type theory" is used to refer to this broader application.

### Relation to [Category Theory](category-theory.md)

The Type is a Category. An instantiation is a morphism. The Instance is the other category.
