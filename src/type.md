> In disciplines such as logic, metalogic, typography, and computer programming, the type–token distinction is a distinction that separates a concept from the objects which are particular instances of the concept. For example, the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage" refers to a token of the type of thing known as "the bicycle", while the sentence "The bicycle has become more popular recently" refers to the type.
