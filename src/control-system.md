> A control system is a device, or set of devices, that manages, commands, directs or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems. Industrial control systems are used in industrial production for controlling an equipment or a machine.

> There are two common classes of control systems, open loop control systems and closed loop control systems. In open loop control systems output is generated based on inputs. In closed loop control systems current output is taken into consideration and corrections are made based on feedback. A closed loop system is also called a feedback control system. The human body is a classic example of feedback control system. Fuzzy logic is also used in control systems.
