> Natural law, or the law of nature (Latin: lex naturalis; ius naturale), is a system of law that is determined by nature, and so is universal. Classically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze human nature — both social and personal — and deduce binding rules of moral behavior from it. Natural law is often contrasted with the positive law of a given political community, society, or state.

[This philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) expands Natural Law to mean the [natural](./nature.md) rules (or fixed [patterns](./pattern.md)) of [Existence](./existence.md). This means all [physical](./physical-existence.md) & [conceptual](./conceptual-existence.md) existence.
