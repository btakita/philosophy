> History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation") is the study of the past, particularly how it relates to humans. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians. Events occurring prior to written record are considered prehistory.

> Herstory is history written from a feminist perspective, emphasizing the role of women, or told from a woman's point of view. It is a neologism coined in the late 1960s as part of a feminist critique of conventional historiography, with the word "history" reinterpreted, using a false etymology, as "his story." (The word "history"—from the Ancient Greek ἱστορία, or historia, meaning "knowledge obtained by inquiry"—is etymologically unrelated to the possessive pronoun his.)

Stories hold [state](./state.md) that can be used for [context](./context.md).

History, from historia, involves "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation". History is often used to mean physical events that have occurred on Earth. Note that true history is subject to the events to be perceived as actually occurring, such as being documented. Various levels of confidence can be ascribed to the documentation. Additional independent documents increase the confidence.

Story means a sequence of events. Story is more general and covers history & fictional work.

### Recounting of a sequence of events/Narrative

A Story is algorithmic. It is often of a low [resolution](./resolution.md), thus requiring relatively little [information](./information.md) to communicate (or transfer) a [Conceptual System](./conceptual-system.md). The context created by the story can be evolved to create more resolution.
