Stories hold [state](./src/state.md) that can be used for [context](./context.md).

Note that history is a masculine [anthropomorphized](./anthropomorphism.md) term. Herstory is a feminine [anthropomorphized](./anthropomorphism.md) term. Ourstory is gender-neutral & inclusive [anthropomorphized](./anthropomorphism.md). Story (the story, this story) does not have the bias of anthropomorphism(./anthropomorphism.md).

## Recounting of a sequence of events/Narrative

A Story is algorithmic. It is often of a low [resolution](./resolution.md), thus requiring relatively little [information](./information.md) to communicate (or transfer) a [Conceptual System](./conceptual-system.md). The context created by the story can be evolved to create more resolution.
