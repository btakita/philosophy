> History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation") is the study of the past, particularly how it relates to humans. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians. Events occurring prior to written record are considered prehistory.

> Herstory is history written from a feminist perspective, emphasizing the role of women, or told from a woman's point of view. It is a neologism coined in the late 1960s as part of a feminist critique of conventional historiography, with the word "history" reinterpreted, using a false etymology, as "his story." (The word "history"—from the Ancient Greek ἱστορία, or historia, meaning "knowledge obtained by inquiry"—is etymologically unrelated to the possessive pronoun his.)

Stories hold [state](./state.md) that can be used for [context](./context.md).

Note that history is a masculine [anthropomorphized](./anthropomorphism.md) term. Herstory is a feminine anthropomorphized term. Ourstory is a gender-neutral anthropomorphized term. Story (the story, this story) does not have the bias of anthropomorphism.

### Recounting of a sequence of events/Narrative

A Story is algorithmic. It is often of a low [resolution](./resolution.md), thus requiring relatively little [information](./information.md) to communicate (or transfer) a [Conceptual System](./conceptual-system.md). The context created by the story can be evolved to create more resolution.
