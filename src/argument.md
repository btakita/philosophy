> In logic and philosophy, an argument is an attempt to persuade someone of something, by giving reasons for accepting a particular conclusion as evident. The general form of an argument in a natural language is that of premises (typically in the form of propositions, statements or sentences) in support of a claim: the conclusion. The structure of some arguments can also be set out in a formal language, and formally defined "arguments" can be made independently of natural language arguments, as in math, logic and computer science.

[Entities](./entity.md) may [agree](./agree.md) on a [concept](./concept.md), yet have a [disagreement](./disagreement.md) rooted in each entity having different [definitions](./definition-based-philosophy.md) in the language they use. When the definitions are different, the entities are talking about different things. Apples to Oranges.
