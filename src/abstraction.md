# Abstraction

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction" target="_blank">Abstraction - Wikipedia</a>

An [entity](./entity.md) has a limited [focus](./focus.md). Abstractions allow a complex set of concepts to be contained within a single concept or word. Abstractions allow different [perspectives](./perspective.md) to be applied to a [system](./system.md).

Abstractions are useful in creating simplified (less [precise](./precision.md)) systems that can relate to a similar system using [analogies](./analogy.md).
