> Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process by which general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal ("real" or "concrete") signifiers, first principles, or other methods. "An abstraction" is the product of this processâ€”a concept that acts as a super-categorical noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a group, field, or category.

## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

An [entity](./entity.md) has a limited [focus](./focus.md). Abstractions allow a complex set of concepts to be contained within a single concept or word. Abstractions allow different [perspectives](./perspective.md) to be applied to a [system](./system.md).

Abstractions are useful in creating simplified (less [precise](./precision.md)) systems that can relate to a similar system using [analogies](./analogy.md).

Abstraction is a form of [illusion](./illusion.md), since it alters the perception of actual entity.

This philosophy takes an approach focusing on the [Evolutionary Linguistics](evolutionary-linguistics.md) (aka abstractions) to create a [model](./model.md) of [Existence](./existence.md) (or [God](./god.md)) that works in any [context](./context.md).
