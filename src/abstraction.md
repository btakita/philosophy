## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

An [entity](./entity.md) has a limited [focus](./focus.md). Abstractions allow a complex set of concepts to be contained within a single concept or word. Abstractions allow different [perspectives](./perspective.md) to be applied to a [system](./system.md).

Abstractions are useful in creating simplified (less [precise](./precision.md)) systems that can relate to a similar system using [analogies](./analogy.md).

Abstraction is a form of [illusion](./illusion.md), since it alters the perception of actual entity.

This philosophy takes an approach focusing on the [Evolutionary Linguistics](evolutionary-linguistics.md) (aka abstractions) to create a [model](./model.md) of [Existence](./existence.md) (or [God](./god.md)) that works in any [context](./context.md).
