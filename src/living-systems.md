In [this philosophy](./this-philosophy.md), all systems are considered "living". See [life](./life.md). The common cultural usage of living system is qualified as a biological living system.

[Living Systems Theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_systems) describes life on the physical realm that has the ability to reproduce.

It is not necessary for a system to reproduce to be living. A eunuch or a mule is considered a living system despite not being able to reproduce.

# [Living Systems Theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_systems)

> Living systems according to Parent (1996) are by definition "open self-organizing systems that have the special characteristics of life and interact with their environment. This takes place by means of information and material-energy exchanges. Living systems can be as simple as a single cell or as complex as a supranational organization such as the European Union. Regardless of their complexity, they each depend upon the same essential twenty subsystems (or processes) in order to survive and to continue the propagation of their species or types beyond a single generation".

This paper indicates organisms living in physical space. These organisms consists of cells, animals, plants, societies, oceans, Earth, etc. Over time the actual physical space occupied by a living system may change considerably.

## General Living Systems Theory

My central thesis is that systems at all levels are open systems composed of subsystems which process inputs, throughputs, and outputs of various forms of matter, energy, and information.

### Matter-energy

"Matter is anything which has mass and occupies physical space. Energy as defined by physics is the ability to do work"

### Information
"the degree of freedom that exist in a given situation to choose among signals, symbols, messages, or patterns to be transmitted"

### Subsystems which process both matter-energy and information:
* Reproducer
* Boundary

### Subsystems which process Matter-energy:
* Ingestor
* Distributor
* Converter
* Producer
* Matter-energy Storage
* Extruder
* Motor
* Supporter

### Subsystems which process information:
* Input transducer
* Internal transducer
* Channel & net
* Decoder
* Associator
* Memory
* Decider
* Encoder
* Output transducer
