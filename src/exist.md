In [this philosophy](./this-philosophy.md), to exist means being contained within the set of [Existence](./existence.md). In the scope of Existence, everything exists, including fiction.

## [Story](./story.md)

In modern culture, to exist often means to exist in Physical Existence. This philosophy [expands](./expanding-consciousness.md) the [scope](./scope) of Existence to be, "Everything that 'is', or more simply, everything".

When everything exists, the entirety of language is open, free of "non-existence". All concepts, such as [God](./god.md), magic, spirituality, exist and are useful abstractions for connecting concepts & deriving [patterns](./pattern.md). These concepts open up closed connections, allowing expanded consciousness & transcendence from materialistic & rationalistic perspectives on Existence.

## [Scoping](./scope.md) Existence

To exist in a scoped Existence means the [entity](./entity.md) exists or does not exist within the scoped Existence. For example, Alice in Wonderland does not exist in Physical Existence but exists in Conceptual Existence.
