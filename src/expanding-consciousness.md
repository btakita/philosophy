# Expanding Consciousness

Expanding Consciousness is our survival & thrival strategy.

[Consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) is the [Perspective on Existence] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence). [Reality](./reality.md) is the experience of consciousness, or the experience of a being perceiving [existence](./existence.md).

Expanding Consciousness is the expanding [perspective](./perspective.md) of a [being](./being.md). A being can be a person, object, animal, collective group of people, a planet, a universe, existence (or [God](./god.md)) itself.

Mastery of a craft often leads to a [spiritual experience](./spirituality.md) because one is in a [state](./state.md) of [coherence](./coherence.md) while performing the craft. With coherence, one is more likely to create something [novel](./novelty.md), thus expanding consciousness.

"Fresh eyes" also expand consciousness by incorporating a novel perspective into the [collective](./collective.md). While masters have proficiency evolving down certain paths, a fresh perspective exposes new paths.

Biological life, and [humans](./human.md), rely on [evolution](./evolution.md) to create novel solutions to transcend the situation.

Humanity is perpetually working to survive and/or thrive. At times the dominant models, institutions, & practices lead to imbalance & instability in global & local [systems](./system.md). [Transcendence](./transcendence.md) from these situations is obtained by evolving successful solutions from inspiration from old & new [concepts](./concept.md).

## Spirituality & Spiritual Work

Spirituality is the desire to expand consciousness. [Spiritual work](./spiritual-work.md) expands consciousness in both the act of doing and with the end result. Spiritual work is the process of transcendence, which allows us to to survive & thrive in our personal & collective situations.
