# Expanding Consciousness

## [Ontology](./ontology.md)

Expanding Consciousness is the expansion of the [consciousness](./consciousness.md) [perspective](./perspective.md) of an [Entity](./entity.md).

## [Axiology](./axiology.md)

### Expanding [Scope](./scope.md) by Connecting [Domains](./domain.md)

Expanding Consciousness can occur when an [abstraction](./abstraction.md) is used in other domains. This leads to connecting the concept to other previously unrelated [domains](./domain.md). These connections allow for more degrees of freedom of [intelligence](./intelligence.md) resulting in expanded consciousness.

### Learning & Forgetting

An entity expands it's consciousness when it accumulates knowledge & experience by the process of learning. The entity contracts it's consciousness by the process of forgetting how to achieve a certain state.

Mastery of a craft often leads to a [spiritual experience](./spirituality.md) because one is in a [state](./state.md) of [coherence](./coherence.md) while performing the craft. With coherence, one is more likely to create something [novel](./novelty.md), thus expanding consciousness.

"Fresh eyes" also expand consciousness by incorporating a novel perspective into the [collective](./collective.md). While masters have proficiency evolving down certain paths, a fresh perspective exposes new paths.

### Evolution

Biological life, and [humans](./human.md), rely on [evolution](./evolution.md) to create novel solutions to transcend the situation.

Humanity is perpetually working to survive and/or thrive. At times the dominant models, institutions, & practices lead to imbalance & instability in global & local [systems](./system.md). [Transcendence](./transcendence.md) from these situations is obtained by evolving successful solutions from inspiration from old & new [concepts](./concept.md).

### Spirituality & Spiritual Work

Spirituality is the desire to expand consciousness. [Spiritual work](./spiritual-work.md) expands consciousness in both the act of doing and with the end result. Spiritual work is the process of transcendence, which allows us to to survive & thrive in our personal & [collective](./collective.md) situations.

> Consciousness is a loosely defined concept that addresses the human awareness of both internal and external stimuli. This can refer to spiritual recognition, psychological understanding, medically altered states, or more modern-day concepts of life purpose, satisfaction, and self-actualization.

> Most theories map consciousness in a series of levels, some stages of which are more continuous or complex than others. Movement between stages is often bidirectional depending on internal and external conditions, with each mental ascension precipitating a change in reactivity. In the most basic sense, this alteration might lead to a reduced responsiveness as seen in anesthesiology; more abstract facets of tiered consciousness describe characteristics of profoundness, insight, perception, or understanding.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_consciousness" target="_blank">Higher consciousness (Wikipedia)</a>

> Higher consciousness is the consciousness of a higher Self, transcendental reality, or God. It is "the part of the human being that is capable of transcending animal instincts".[1] The concept developed in German Idealism, and is a central notion in contemporary popular spirituality.
