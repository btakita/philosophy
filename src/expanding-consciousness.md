# Expanding Consciousness

Expanding Consciousness is our survival & thrival strategy.

[Consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) is the [Perspective on Existence] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence). [Reality](./reality.md) is the experience of consciousness, or the experience of a being perceiving existence.

Expanding Consciousness is the expanding [perspective](./perspective.md) of a [being](./being.md). A being can be a person, object, animal, collective group of people, a planet, a universe, existence itself.

Mastery of a craft often leads to a [spiritual experience](./spirituality.md) because one is in a state of coherence while performing the craft. With coherence, one is more likely to create something [novel](./novelty.md), thus expanding consciousness.

"Fresh eyes" also expand consciousness by incorporating a novel perspective into the [collective](./collective.md). While masters have proficiency evolving down certain paths, a fresh perspective exposes new paths.

Biological life, and [humans](./human.md), rely on [evolution](./evolution.md) to create novel solutions to transcend the situation.

Humanity is in a struggle to survive. Our dominant models, institutions, & practices have lead to an imbalance & instability in our global & local [systems](./system.md). We are in need of transcendence by evolving successful solutions, combining sustainable ancient teachings with new solutions.

Spirituality is the desire to expand consciousness. Spiritual work expands consciousness in both the act of doing and with the end result. New solutions & breakthroughs occur. Spiritual work is the process of transcendence, which allows us to to survive & thrive in our personal & collective situations.
