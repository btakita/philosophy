## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

Expanding Consciousness is the expansion of the [consciousness](./consciousness.md) or [perspective](./perspective.md) of an [entity](./entity.md).

### Expanding [Scope](./scope.md) by Connecting [Domains](./domain.md)

Expanding Consciousness can occur when an [abstraction](./abstraction.md) is used in other domains. This leads to connecting the concept to other previously unrelated [domains](./domain.md). These connections allow for more degrees of freedom of [intelligence](./intelligence.md) resulting in expanded consciousness.

### Learning & Forgetting

An entity expands it's consciousness when it accumulates knowledge & experience by the process of learning. The entity contracts it's consciousness by the process of forgetting how to achieve a certain state.

Mastery of a craft often leads to a [spiritual experience](./spirituality.md) because one is in a [state](./state.md) of [coherence](./coherence.md) while performing the craft. With coherence, one is more likely to create something [novel](./novelty.md), thus expanding consciousness.

"Fresh eyes" also expand consciousness by incorporating a novel perspective into the [collective](./collective.md). While masters have proficiency evolving down certain paths, a fresh perspective exposes new paths.

### Evolution

Biological life, and [humans](./human.md), rely on [evolution](./evolution.md) to create novel solutions to transcend the situation.

Humanity is perpetually working to survive and/or thrive. At times the dominant models, institutions, & practices lead to imbalance & instability in global & local [systems](./system.md). [Transcendence](./transcendence.md) from these situations is obtained by evolving successful solutions from inspiration from old & new [concepts](./concept.md).

### Spirituality & Spiritual Work

Spirituality is the desire to expand consciousness. [Spiritual work](./spiritual-work.md) expands consciousness in both the act of doing and with the end result. Spiritual work is the process of transcendence, which allows us to to survive & thrive in our personal & [collective](./collective.md) situations.
