# An Evolutionary Group

An Evolutionary Group is comprised of beings who facilitate the evolution of the group & it's members with the intent of expanding consciousness. Other people can also help one see beyond oneself, thus expanding perspective & consciousness.

States follow the principle of strength in numbers. However, states tend to have regulating effects on the population, reducing novelty.

Large civilizations also encourage novelty by allowing specialization. Specialization allows further evolution along disciplines.

However, having specialization can lead to disconnection, as one loses the cross-pollenatization of working on & interacting with those specializing in other things.
