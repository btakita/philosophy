## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

An Evolutionary Group is comprised of [beings](./being.md) who [expand the consciousness](./expanding-consciousness.md) (via [evolution](./evolution.md)) of each being within the [collective](./collective.md). Each member helps the other members see beyond oneself, thus expanding consciousness.

### Civilization [Story](./story.md)

Civilization states follow the principle of strength in numbers. However, states tend to have regulating effects on the population, reducing [novelty](./novelty.md).

Large civilizations also encourage novelty by allowing specialization. Specialization allows further evolution along disciplines.

However, having specialization can lead to disconnection, as one loses the cross-pollenatization of working on & interacting with those specializing in other subjects.
