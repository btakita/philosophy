# Idolatry

## [Ontology](./ontology.md)

The interpretation of [Existence](./existence) or [God](./god.md) as something less than the [Universal Set](./universal-set.md) of Existence.

## [Axiology](./axiology.md)

Idolatry is the pattern that limit's the size of Existence. Idolatry removes possibilities & novelty from a [perspective](./perspective.md). While we [scope](./scope.md) [systems](./system.md) to focus on a system, being unable to expand scope to Existence renders the Entity unable to conceptualize whatever is in Existence.

Some [religions](./religion.md) define God as an [Entity](./entity.md) less than (a part of) Existence (e.g. the creator of the [Physical Universe](./physical-system.md)). The practical impact is a subset of existence is God and nothing outside of the idolized entity exists.

One may see another Entity as being existentially surrounded by the Entity. The surrounding Entity is effectively a portal to God.

> Idolatry is a pejorative term for the worship of an idol or a physical object such as a cult image as a god, or practices believed to verge on worship, such as giving honour and regard to created forms. In all the Abrahamic religions idolatry is strongly forbidden, although views as to what constitutes idolatry may differ within and between them. In other religions the use of cult images is accepted. Which images, ideas, and objects constitute idolatry is often a matter of considerable contention.

### [Pattern](./pattern.md) Expression

Idolatry is a pattern that is applicable anywhere in [Existence](./existence.md).

Idolatry can occur with Entities who exhibit the [freedom](./freedom.md) to understand the concept of Existence.
