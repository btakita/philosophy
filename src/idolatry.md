## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

Some religions define [God](./god.md) as an [Entity](./entity.md) less than (a part of) [Existence](./existence.md) (e.g. the creator of the [Physical Universe](./physical-system.md)). The practical impact is a subset of existence is God and nothing outside of the idolized entity exists.
