# Idolatry

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry" target="_blank">Idolatry (Wikipedia)</a>

The definition of [God](./god.md) as an [Entity](./entity.md) less than (a part of) [Existence](./existence.md). The practical impact is a subset of existence is God and nothing outside of the idolized entity exists.
