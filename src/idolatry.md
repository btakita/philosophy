> Idolatry is a pejorative term for the worship of an idol or a physical object such as a cult image as a god, or practices believed to verge on worship, such as giving honour and regard to created forms. In all the Abrahamic religions idolatry is strongly forbidden, although views as to what constitutes idolatry may differ within and between them. In other religions the use of cult images is accepted. Which images, ideas, and objects constitute idolatry is often a matter of considerable contention.

## [This Philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) Definition

The interpretation of God or Existence as something less than the Universal Set of Existence.

Some [religions](./religion.md) define [God](./god.md) as an [Entity](./entity.md) less than (a part of) [Existence](./existence.md) (e.g. the creator of the [Physical Universe](./physical-system.md)). The practical impact is a subset of existence is God and nothing outside of the idolized entity exists.

One may see another Entity as being existentially surrounded by the Entity. The surrounding Entity is effectively a portal to God.
