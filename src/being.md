> Being is an extremely broad concept encompassing objective and subjective features of reality and existence. Anything that partakes in being is also called a "being", though often this use is limited to entities that have subjectivity (as in the expression "human being"). So broad a notion has inevitably been elusive and controversial in the history of philosophy, beginning in western philosophy with attempts among the pre-Socratics to deploy it intelligibly.

### [Pattern](./pattern.md) Expression

There are many synonyms to a Being. The reason for this split in [language](./language.md) relates to the [implicit scope](./implicit-scope.md) of the [definition](./definition.md) of [Intelligence](./intelligence.md).

[This philosophy](./this-philosophy.md) broadens the scope of the definition of [Intelligence](./intelligence.md). [Cultural](./culture.md) definition of intelligence varies, and is commonly synonymous with Biological Intelligence, [Human](./human.md) Intelligence, etc.
