# Category Theory

## [Ontology](./ontology.md)

Category theory is used to formalize mathematics and its concepts as a collection of objects and arrows (also called morphisms). Category theory can be used to formalize concepts of other high-level abstractions such as set theory, ring theory, and group theory. Several terms used in category theory, including the term "morphism", differ from their uses within mathematics itself. In category theory, a "morphism" obeys a set of conditions specific to category theory itself. Thus, care must be taken to understand the context in which statements are made.

## [Axiology](./axiology.md)

Category Theory is utilized where [abstractions](./abstraction.md) are categories and [scopes](./scope.md) are morphisms. Connections between abstractions are also morphisms.

### Modeling our Thoughts using Category Theory

Abstractions can be considered categories. Abstractions can be connected by a morphism. Abstractions can also be learned (a morphism).

### Structure of the Definitions

The structure of the [definitions](./definition.md) in this philosophy are nested categories.

The sub-sections:

* Cultural Definition
* This Philosophy Definition

And subsections of the subsections are also categories.
