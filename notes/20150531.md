Great weekend!

Hung out with Liz. Made some breakthroughs in identifying some of my thought processes with her.

"Let me know if you need help getting in" I said in a flat monotone.

My spirit was skewed, taxing my energy.

My brain processes were unfocused.

The separating learned behavior creates a context which inhibits connection. Yet I desire connection. Love & desire will have to win out.

Fortunately, I am a conscious being capable of evaluating & transcending my patterns.
