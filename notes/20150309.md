How can I stay grounded in who I am regardless of the situation I'm in?

Black Hummer limo on a cobblestone street with a manhole & townhouses lining the street.

Dark red buildings.

Pippin paid me a visit.

I thought of Robert & woman whom I got my mantra with from Amma.

I felt the light.

The tangled dark string in the heart became light.

The fog in the solar plexus became light.

Sex
Frustration
Being Alone
Self Work
