If you havn't already, please read up on Agenda 21/Agenda 2020. A hidden objective may be to move the population into city centers & limit personal mobility. An urban population is easier to socially engineer & control than a rural population.

And yes, the environment is often a compelling selling point to convince the population to submit themselves to structures of authority via taxation, wealth redistribution, removal of personal freedoms, heavy police presence, perception deception, powerful exoteric institutions that exert it's collectivism will on all individuals. Sort of like how knowing of a phenomena, like the time of a solar eclipse, can enable one to extort "protection" from an ignorant society. Information tends to be Asymmetric & Information Asymmetries can be used to various purposes.

It's important to be good stewards of the environment & it's equally important to not give up our personal responsibility & autonomy to authority figures.
