Hi folks
It was a pleasure meeting you this past weekend.

At the bottom of this message, I've included a flyer for the water harvesting intensive I mentioned I'd be teaching in southern Quebec May 1-6.  Please share it widely

As promised, here's the dropbox link for the slide shows I shared

Here's my on-line design portfolio.  You may find these examples helpful as you begin your own designs.

And here are some on-line design tools I find invaluable in my work..

Find climate data for a site
http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/climatenormals/climatenormals.pl?directive=prod_select2&prodtype=CLIM20&subrnum=

Calculate Solar Positioning and Microclimatic Details
http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/

Magnetic Declination Calculator
http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomagmodels/Declination.jsp

Web Soil Survey - find soil data for a site
http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx
and Soil Web
http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/

Hardiness zones and plant maps for your zip code
http://www.plantmaps.com/

Planimeter - Measure the area of a piece of land 
http://acme.com/planimeter/

FEMA Flood Maps
https://hazards.fema.gov/wps/portal/mapviewer

and plant databases....

Plants for a Future on-line useful plant database
http://pfaf.org/user/default.aspx

http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?init=Ecol
An ecological communities database

The US Forest Service Fire Effects Information Service
http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/


and finally - iPhone apps

Measure Map - the 'lite' version is free.  This tool allows you to measure distance and area and automatically defaults to wherever you are when you open it.  Pretty awesome.

SoilWeb - yup that's right - soil data/types for your location

Sun Seeker - map the path of the sun across your horizon at winter/summer solstice and more.  At $8 it's an incredibly economical option when compared with a $300 solar path finder.
