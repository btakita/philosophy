I'm searching for home. Home is where the heart is.

I'm searching for a place to rest my heart. I will go anywhere to find home.

If you give me a home, I am yours. I want to create something beautiful with you.

I want to heal the world with you. I want to have a child with you.

I need you to go at your own pace, because I'm crazy. I will fall deeply, madly in love with you. The raging fire in me needs to be tempered by reality & grounded. If you need me to give you the gift of falling deeply, madly in love, I will give it to you. I will be what you need me to be. I will suffer the throes of death & birth because transcendence is the reward.
