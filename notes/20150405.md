Some notes on terminology. I've been mentioning *Distributed Systems*. Distributed systems use centralized & decentralized patterns. Centralization & Decentralization are vectors or directions that we can take the system in. Also note that we are speaking of models that we create to describe how things work now, in the past, & in the future.

Centralization is effective at organizing knowledge & bureaucratic top-down control. Centralized repositories of information make the information easier to find. A major disadvantage of Centralized control systems is the complexity increases at a geometric or exponential rate. This means the costs & overhead rapidly increase with complexity. That is why Centralized big ag must remain simple. It scales in distribution but cannot scale in complexity.

Decentralization enables balanced resource distribution, quick feedback/evolution cycles, diversity, scalable complexity, redundancy, etc. Decentralization is inherently more difficult to control from the top down.

Decentralization is akin to feminine nature. Centralization is akin to masculine ego. An effective system includes both polarities acting in a harmonic balance.

A Distributed System consists of Entities that utilize both centralization & decentralization. We can model our current governance system as a decentralized system with many Entities acting with each other.

"There is no example of an intensive food production system that wasn't centralized, but history obviously simultaneously warns us to design regenerative, fertile systems that respect soil and water resources."

This statement is through the lens of agriculture. By far, the biggest "intensive food production system" is nature. Humans have recently (relative to Earth's timescale) began creating agriculture. Agriculture is inherently requires some management to yield the patterns of plants, animals, mycelium, etc that we can use. This management is going to be more centralized than nature.

Now we are seeing that inappropriate use of a solution has become the problem. We have overrelied on a large scale, simplistic (because controlled complexity does not scale), methods of agriculture. Our current situation is the "fruit" of our efforts.

The egoic mind desires to control & simplify/destroy what it cannot control. We are learning that the result of the egoic desire to control is not sustainable. We can no longer export our waste, since we are now a globally connected civilization. Nature does not waste. So we must move toward decentralization in our production & control systems as much as possible. Centralization must be used to support ourselves & our efforts to create evolutionary complex systems, which require decentralization.

Some things that are effectively centralized are information (i.e. the internet), simple ecological governance (i.e. don't pollute waterways with hazardous waste, continuously improve your ecosystem that you are stewarding), simple social order (i.e. don't commit violence), etc.
