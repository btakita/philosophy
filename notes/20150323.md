Too many facts.

Facts, while true, can be manipulative. Facts are only true within a context.

Instead of focusing on facts, focus on values & principles. Values & principles change people.

We have too many facts. We are bludgeoned by facts until our minds turn off. What can we do with these facts other than regurgitate them & argue about them? Do facts make you happy?
