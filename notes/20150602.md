For the US, another other actionable thing is to prepare for the inevitable decline of the Empire. That means measures along the lines as:

* phase out exploiting subject nations & build their autonomy

* decentralize food production using local farms & polycultures

* reduce global free trade of goods

* empower local communities to self-govern

* nationalize the currency & allow communities to have their own currencies

* support industry, food production & discourage finance

* reduce the national government
