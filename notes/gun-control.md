Dan, the 2nd Amendment is in place for good reason. It ensures a balance of power between the law abiding citizenry & the criminal government, gangs, cartels, etc. If you repeal the 2nd Amendment, you might as well repeal the 1st Amendment because the whole Constitution is protected by the citizenry, which requires this balance of Power.

Let's say you outlaw guns, like they do in Mexico, Chicago, China, France, etc. Who is going to own the guns? The state & people who are breaking the law (i.e. criminals).

So now you have criminals who have a lethal advantage over people who follow the law.

Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the USA, yet it is in the top 5 for every category of violent crime.

In Mexico, Los Zetas, Sinaloa, MS-13 terrorize the population & the law-abiding population cannot defend itself. Over 100,000 people have been murdered in the past decade in Mexico & guns are illegal there!

But cartel violence in Mexico is small potatoes compared to state violence on their populations. Stalin, Hitler, & Mao outlawed guns. Guess what happened? Over 100 million people died. Let's take a moment to reflect on it because it's a number & it's easy to gloss over.

One Hundred Million People dead.

Now yes, any unnecessary deaths are bad. Currently in the USA, we face some problems. Fortunately, we have the 1st Amendment & the 2nd Amendment. However, we have some gun deaths. More people die from automobile accidents. Far more die from medical malpractice. More die from drugs.

We have far larger problems to focus on than gun violence. We have cultural problems & imbalances of power. Yet you are focusing on creating more power imbalance. Are you for Communism? Because destroying the 2nd Amendment will lead us straight there. Communism has killed over 100 Million people, btw...

If you care so much about saving lives, there are other things to focus on that will save more lives than what you incorrectly imagine banning guns would.
