Build a Swale to shield muddy low road
Water Management & Drainage
  Crown/slope the roads so puddles don't form
  Drain water into swales & ponds
  Large enough piping for water to pass underneath roads where applicable
  Raise low roads above water table
Gravel and/or pavement to increase traction & remove puddles/mud
Build Barriers around property to keep fauna in/out
Natural Deicing Solutions
Improve soil retention/drainage of water
Reduce runoff
Bind Pipes/Electrical units together
  Well marked
  Close to road
Parking
Road Parking
Golf Cart/Buggy for local transport
