I wish life were easier.

I wish we all got along with each other.

I wish my interests were aligned with others' interests.

I need guards in my soul to make me slow down & process impulses.

I need to understand my triggers.

I need to love.

The endless need to process thing with others needs to stop.

The buck stops here.

I take responsibility for my actions.

I only have true empathy when I feel resonance with the situation.

I feel anxiety around women because I am playing an emotional program of wanting love from a woman.
