Hello Katherine! I had a great time meeting you at your place. It was also fun hanging with you, Frank, Mike, & Alexa.
 
I'd love to get you know you better. I like your open heart, vibrancy, & sense of humor. I'm working on expanding consciousness through humorous & playful exchanges. I've been serious for a looong time.

I'm looking forward to seeing you around soon.
