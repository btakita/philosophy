Here's another way to look at it that considers that there is more to the institutions of political parties than meets the eye. Many Republicans & Democrats are two faces of the same coin, being financed by many of the same Entities. In the current context, a couple of more apt distinctions are Globalist vs Nationalist and Technocrat vs Constitutionalist (Republic).

Globalist vs Nationalist

Those who advocate for world government & multinational corporations vs those who advocate for the the sovereignty of a state.

Technocrat vs Constitutionalist

Similar to Globalist vs Nationalist distinction. Technocrats tend to favor regulation, bureaucracy/technocracy, institutional monopolies, all rights provided by the State. Constitutionalists tend to favor Liberty/Freedom, avoid monopolies when possible, all rights given from God with the State acting as guardian & violator of rights.

From these distinctions, the lines become more obvious. It is pooled global capital (Globalist/Technocrats - acting through the politicians, the Mainstream Media, & major technology companies) acting in it's own interests. So while Marrissa Mayer may have caused Yahoo's stock to crash, she steered the institution of Yahoo (with audience, IP Portfolio, exclusive agreements) to act in the interests of the Globalist/Technocrats. Evidence of this is Yahoo's pivot from being a service provider to being a holder of IP.
