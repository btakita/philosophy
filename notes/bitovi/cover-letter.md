Hello, I have been working as a consultant, building up a monorepo tech stack that I use with multiple clients.

https://github.com/ctx-core/ctx-core

CanJS, DoneJS, & StealJS all look like great tools. While I have not used these tools, I have created & used similar tools for my clients. For example, I have had success using a ctx object & agents, that works like can-compute with initializer functions mutating the passed-in (DI) ctx object.

The tech (technology/techniques) I cultivated is novel & has been tuned over several project generations. Nonetheless, I'm always open to evolving my process/model & I have the flexibility/humility to make necessary changes in the pursuit of utilizing solutions that are in line with the natural laws of information/patterns.

Otherwise, I'm into Personal Liberty/Autonomy, Restorative Agriculture/Permaculture, Systemic Thinking/Models, Domain Languages/NLP/Frames of Reference, Pursuing Truth. I'm moving to Chattanooga, TN to have a closer relationship to the land & to practice autonomous living with my partner & future family. I feel like I can be a benefit to your collective & vice versa, so please give me a ring.

Thank you,
Brian
