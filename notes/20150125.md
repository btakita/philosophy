## Epiphenomena & Free Will

Causality is perceived to be caused by strong correlations & plasticity. However, weaker neural paths can be chosen.

In hindsight, we want to associate a chain of causality to our decisions. Each decision we make can be broken down to the physical interactions. Perhaps if we can figure out the patterns of the physical phenomena, we can predict somebody's decisions.

That may be an illusory goal. Information has patterns. The Physical System may take on information patterns. A physical analogy to the information may be created. This analog system may be the machine.

Science is a process to measure confidence in a system's patterns of cause & effect.

The domain of science is limited in what it can measure. "Non-linear" systems may not be possible to model with science. There may be a theory taking into account the constraints of the system.

An observational rule may be different from a creative rule. Creative rules (aka heuristics) are often simpler since there is a smaller set of outcomes. They tend to be first-order decisions that don't need to utilize projective hierarchies.

Observational rules are often quantified using statistics.

Is anxiety an accumulation of fear?

## Death Rowe Inmate

A Death Rowe Inmate with a chance of a pardon will feel more anxiety than without a chance of pardon.

The Death Rowe Inmate will have a fear of death. The fear of death may cause much anxiety to the point where the probability of pardon is high.

The chance of a pardon adds additional anxiety to the Inmate.

Mind Body Paradox

Can a neural pattern occur within multiple instances? If yes, then that is evidence that conceptual information processing occurs independently of the actual physical composition.

Another confirmation would be if the same information pattern (state) can be programmed into a different physical substrate, like silicon. The constituent parts must be identified.

---

The brain can identify paradoxes by a creative pattern.

One can create a paradox from a context.

One can also search prospective contexts that would be good basis for a paradox. This search can be improved by practice (learned sensitivity).

> The intuitive idea is that if you could make a physical copy of a person, you'd also be making a psychological copy of that person. The reverse does not hold: two people could be in the same mental state, but that mental state could be supported by different brain states (the same mental state could be "multiply realizable" by different brain states). The properties in B are called the base properties (or sometimes subjacent or subvenient properties), and the properties in A are called the supervenient properties.

In a Star Trek teleportation device, the physical state of the body is copied from one location to another.

> Supervenience has traditionally been used to describe relationships between sets of properties in a manner which does not imply a strong reductive relationship. For example, many hold that economic properties supervene on physical properties, in that if two worlds were exactly the same physically, they would also be the same economically. However, this does not entail that economics can be reduced in any straightforward way to physics. Thus, supervenience allows one to hold that "high-level phenomena" (like those of economics, psychology, or aesthetics) depend, ultimately, on physical substance, without assuming that one can study those high-level phenomena using means appropriate to physics.

Multiple systems on multiple abstraction levels are at play.

Mathematics is not the most efficient mapping to mental states.

Mathematics does allow algorithmic abstraction.
