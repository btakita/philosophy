When talking to the IRS today, I felt my solar plexus & root chakra in pain. I felt uncertainty & unsafe.

However, I made the calls I was supposed to make. I am happy & proud of myself for having the strength to do what I needed to do. I did not make excuses or make it the responsibility of an imaginary person.
