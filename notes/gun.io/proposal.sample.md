Hello,

My name is Brian. I live in Chattanooga, TN & I've been developing web apps for over 15 years for a number of startups & agencies in San Francisco, Los Angeles, & New York City. My technology of choice is Node.js but I also have experience with Ruby on Rails, & PHP/Wordpress.

I have extensive experience creating working consumer quality apps from initial ideation, to sketch, to implementation.

Though I have not developed using the SAP platform, I have developed using a number of other platforms including Salesforce. I'm available to start on the project.

Here are some of my online profiles:
