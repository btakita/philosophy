Mistaken concept of Keyline

Incorrect:
* Keyline extend to ridge
* Keylines & Keypoint are on the same elevation
** Geography - Each Crest is of a different elevation. The crests have a descending relationship with each other. The valleys also have different elevations from each other.

Keylines are a set of local systems?

A Keyline is a local Valley/Ridge transition?

Keypoint: The cross-section of the inflection point (Convex to Concave)
