A spiritual experience can be triggered by work. Work is the activity that adults spend most of their conscious time performing.

Mastery of a task brings out zen experiences, or being in "the zone", when performing the task. Mastery is often attained when doing something that you enjoy enough to practice. The master can get into "the zone" regularly.

The feeling of [harmony & coherence](http://www.meditationplex.com/meditation-benefits/effects-meditation-brain-coherence-intelligence/) has beneficial effects on creativity & health. This creativity leads to novelty, or something new & different. This novelty expands the consciouness of the creator & the collective of humanity, thus is a Spiritual endeavor.

Novelty that contributes to coherence & stimulation of more global novelty.
