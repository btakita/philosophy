# Pattern

[Pattern - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern)

The elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable or regular manner. Any of the five traditionally accepted senses may directly observe patterns. Abstract patterns in science, spirit, mathematics, or language require conceptual & extrasensory senses.
