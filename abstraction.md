[Abstraction: A Historical and Interdisciplinary Perspective](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SARA/SARA13/paper/download/7249/6267)

An [entity](./entity.md) has a limited focus. Abstractions allow a complex set of concepts to be contained within a single concept or word. Abstractions allow different [perspectives](./perspective.md) to be applied to a system.

Abstractions are useful in creating simplified (less [precise](./precision.md)) systems that can relate to a similar system using [analogies](./analogy.md).
