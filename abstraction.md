# Abstraction

[Abstraction - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction)

An [entity](./entity.md) has a limited focus. Abstractions allow a complex set of concepts to be contained within a single concept or word. Abstractions allow different [perspectives](./perspective.md) to be applied to a system.

Abstractions are useful in creating simplified (less precise) systems that can relate to a similar system using [analogies](./analogy.md).
