Redefinitions of words is used to expand or contract the consciousness of the being. A redefinition can expand consciousness by expanding the scope of the meaning while keeping a connection to the more precise, narrower scoped, meaning.

One can focus on the "spirit" of the word in the modern context. Intending to increase the relevancy of words and shed the historical inaccuracies that the words have accumulated and expanding overly narrow scopes.

Redefinitions of words can also contract consciousness by being inaccurate or narrowing scope of the meaning of the word, while disregarding the expanded meaning of the word.

Words have some degree of imprecise meanings. For example, God has an imprecise meaning in across different belief systems since the definition of God varies across these belief systems. I, Brian Takita, define God as being Existence, thus being everything.

Word definitions influence thoughts and symbolic abstractions that a being relates with. One can be grounded with culturally defined terminology to effectively communicate within the cultural context. However, one can expand the consciousness of the culture, by expanding the scope of the words.

Here are some arguments against redefinitions.

There may be confusion caused from redefinition. I seek to make these redefinitions explicit & make the audience aware of these redefinitions. Inspiring thought of the implications of these redefinitions help the audience think of Existence with a new perspective.

# Scope & Precision

A challenge of word definitions are the Scope & Precision ambiguity. Definitions vary in ambiguity. The Scope & Precision can be altered to apply to more or less domains when redefining a word.

Broadening the scope of words, so it applies to more domains, allows analogies to apply to the sentence where the word is used. Compound words, qualifying words, and sentence context can be used to narrow the scope of the word's definition.

Expanding consciousness, like expanding space-time, tends to utilize the constituent parts expanding. This means the scope of definitions tend to expand as consciousness expands. When communicating a precise meaning, context is applied to the definition.

Michael Graziano has a model of the Attention Schema regarding symbolic definitions. This schema is temporal and changes within the being based on the internal model & the current context.

A being with a consistent & unified consciousness can use a similar attention schema across multiple contexts. If the being can efficiently isolate the precision & accuracy of the optimal attention schema based on the situational context, then the being can effectively isolate the optimal definitions to think & express optimal meaning.

A being can learn by efficiently expanding consciousness. Expanding consciousness, via the attention schema, involves learning new terminology, expanding the scope of existing terminology, and increasing effectiveness of the precision context of the existing terminology.

# Precision Context

The Precision Context involves creating the precise Attention Schema by using contextual clues, qualifying words, and compound words. The precise Attention Schema is zoomed in to provide precise detail & expanded differentiation across the Attention Schema.
