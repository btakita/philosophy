I hope you are great as well. Thank you for reaching out.

I've been apathetically following wikileaks for a while. I've always been into transparency, open government, & making the world better.

The leaks have been shockingly revealing about the inner working of Government, Industry, Media, Military, Intelligence, Finance, NGOs. Since then, I've been researching numerous sources to evolve my model of what's going on.

There is quite a bit of literature (maligned as "conspiracy theory") out there. I have to say that pieces are coming together. Predictions are coming true & patterns are obvious.

Major changes are happening right now & I believe that the world needs to know. My main challenge is explaining the workings of the system; how events relate to the obfuscated (often in plain sight) network of entities that comprise of this network. There's quite a bit of misinformation, muddied waters, & dumbing down of culture (intellectually, emotionally, & spiritually) that it's difficult to have a clear conversation while keeping sight of the big picture.

For example, why are most companies not transparent with their employees (ie you must climb the ladder to know more)? Keeping knowledge asymmetric is a tool for some to control many.
When individuals are empowered with knowledge, control is loosed & overall everybody flourishes. However, not all entities are willing to let loose their grasp where it does not make sense. Why else would we have the same worldwide problems despite throwing trillions at "solutions"? The "solutions" become institutions to act as a UI for the citizens of the world & that particular subject. The solution is the problem. The problem is the solution. Perception is reality.

Sadly, we (the majority of the world) is in peril. The systems that have enslaved us would rather cull most of the world than share resources on their lands. The powers that be do not share. They swear secret oaths & live in a secret culture. Culture being our social "operating system". The same patterns/behaviors in the micro apply to the macro.
