I have nothing against people getting (non-compulsive) vaccinations, assuming that there is transparency in how the vaccines are produced/researched & scientific studies are not rigged. Also, the public must understand that vaccines can be a weapon of tyranny & Democide. There are people in high levels who believe that the world to too populated & we need to "cull" the population.

There has been much shaming & name calling over opinions that challenge the status quo. This intentional maligning the opposition, without understanding where they are coming from, is fundamentally against the Democratic process.
