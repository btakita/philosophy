Scott, I empathize with your family being impacted during WW2. All of our families were to varying degrees. Chad, I understand that there has been much oppression in this country. I think it's best to find out exactly how these vehicles of oppression work before fighting something that is not the problem.

Re: WW2, George Soros (Financier of Hillary's campaign, Financial Terrorist (according to Putin), Open Society) was a Nazi Collaborator!

Hillary is also connected with the Rothschilds.

Hillary is much more connected to dictators, mass murderers, eugenicists, Nazi descendants, & their ilk; then Trump ever will be. I think Trump will do his best to dismantle or reform such racist institutions.

Did you know that financiers funded both sides of WW2? IBM, The Warburg/Rothschild families. In fact, you are going to love this, there was much propaganda & myths about the war. I'm still researching & seeing what gets revealed.

I am a bit more familiar with after WW2 & the formation of the UN & the CIA during that time. Here are some referenced facts I took from "Mass Control: Engineering Human Consciousness". It shows how Eugenics was a well funded research topic & how Nazi Eugenicists founded what became the "Human Genome Project". 
 
The study of Eugenics started with Rudolph Virchow (Germany, 1871) & Francis Galton (England, 1869, cousin of C Darwin). Karl Marx was also active during that time.
 
* "Eugenics in Working Society" (London, 1904)
* "Galton Laboratory for National Eugenics" (1907)
* "Eugenics Records Office" (Rockefellers & Carnegies, Cold Springs, NY, 1905) - Genetic Research still being performed at the same facilities
* From 1907-1960, between 100,000-150,000 people (many Native Americans) were eugenically sterilized in over 30 States
* Rockefeller Foundation also bankrolled German Eugenics research during Third Reich
* Ernst Rudin, Otmar Verschuer, Franz J. Kallmann ran the "Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Psychiatry" & the "Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Athropology, Eugenics, ande Human Heredity" (Munich)
* Josef Mengele (aka "the Angel of Death") was put in charge of Auschwitz & performed experiments on the population 

After WW2, German scientists moved to the West & Russia

* Otmar Versheur (employed under Mengele at Auschwitz) was hired by Rockefeller-funded "Bureau of Human Heredity" (Denmark) 
* Rudin, Vershuer, Kallmann founded "American Society of Human Genetics" (Human Genome Project)

* British National Association for Mental Health (NAMH, 1944) manager Montagu Norman, initially employed with the Bank of England, met Hitler (with collegues) at his home in the 1930s to arrange financing for Hitler
* NAMH, previously known as "National Councils of Mental Hygiene" was a primary proponent of worldwide eugenics programs
* In 1948, NAMH & Tavistock Institute (in collaboration with British Intelligence & Psychiatry) created the "International Congress of Mental Health" at the "Ministry of Health in London"
* MKULTRA (CIA, 1950s-1973) mass mind control research program formed out of that conference

Note that there are new suspicious foundations/organizations:

* "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation" - top donor to the "Clinton Foundation" https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors
* "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation" is the largest funder of vaccines (& some say Eugenics http://www.nowtheendbegins.com/bill-gates-and-eugenics-the-world-needs-fewer-people/)
* Monsanto - Worlds #1 GMO, petrol-chemical producers. Also a chemical weapons company
* Monsanto was pushed (via threats) by Hillary's State Department http://www.fooddemocracynow.org/campaign/hillary-s-monsanto-how-clinton-state-department-became-global-marketing-arm-monsanto

Would you consider the current brand of consumerism a form of fascism? ie. The transfer of wealth from the middle & lower classes to the rich, allowing the rich to buy land, water, food production, resources, labor, energy production, setting prices & creating a WalMart effect on the local economy. Wages are kept low, & off the books workers (ie illegal immigrants), drive down wages.

Re: immigration policy, we are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. The best immigrants should be allowed to come in. Criminals, ISIS, & preferable Fundamentalist Shariah Law Islamists keep out.

Illegal immigrants are mostly working, but they are "shadow" citizens, enduring hardships & low wages. Many are involved with the drug trade.

Drugs should be made legal, following the Portugal model, to remove the profits from the illegal drug economy. Any president would be hard pressed to make the CIA/Mexican Cartels let go of controlling illegal drugs.

The 2nd Amendment is crucial to keeping checks & balances with personal protection (against Government, Organized/Unorganized Crime). Gun ownership is illegal in Mexico, yet the gun violence is very high.
