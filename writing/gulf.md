# Gulf

I feel a gulf between where I am & where I will be. The wall that was the cocoon, the womb protecting...nurturing...smothering...yielding...

The fire rages within, yet is muted by my befuddled exterior.

Nothing passes through. The fire is unknown.

Everything has significance but no obvious meaning.

A madman raves, seeing connections that aren't there. Or aren't visible. But it's just a feeling. Something lingering...

Just get it out. Feel good. I feel what I feel. What my soul creates. It's not pleasant at times.

It's the darkness we all feel. That unavoidable pull toward the abyss. The feeling that nothing is right, yet is all right.

The turbulent chaos in it's inviting pattern. The seething beast breathing fear.

But it's nothing. Just a feeling.
