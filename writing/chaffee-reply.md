Dude, calm down. Everything is ok. We can have rational discussions in the pursuit of truth & not resort to ad hominem.

There's some speculation & theories on what is happening, but here is what I see.

There a set of multinational bankers, Central Banks, investors, states, & other capitalized interests that form shifting alliances. Their goal is to collectively control the world (& it's resources) & switch to a "New World Order". While there may be some bickering over "fiefdoms", the collective effort is to exert control over everything, especially individuals through financial, military, & cultural control.

ISIS (formerly Al Qaeda) was formed in Iraq.

They were empowered by Saudi financial interests, US Military Equipment & Training. Note that Wikipedia has it labeled under "Conspiracy Theory" so you know it's bias.

Some things that occurred in Iraq were:

Gaddafi created a gold-backed currency called the dinar that would challenge the legitimacy of the US Petrol Dollar. He wanted to create a post-colonial United Africa, gaining independence from colonial interests & central banks. He reinvested oil revenues back to the Libyan people.
