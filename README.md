philosophy
==========

A [Perspective](./src/perspective.md) on [Existence](./src/existence.md) or [God](./src/god.md).

## Goals

This [philosophy](./src/philosophy.md) seeks to define words as [abstractions](./src/abstraction.md). These [scope](./src/scope.md) of these abstractions are broadened to apply, with proper [context](./src/context.md), to any [entity](./src/entity.md) in existence.

This philosophy seeks to be a [tool](./src/tool.md) of expanding consciousness.

## [Scope](./src/scope.md) & [Resolution](./src/resolution.md)

Since scope of this Philosophy is Existence/God, the resolution tends to be low. More detail can be referenced with outbound links.

This philosophy defines abstractions in relation to Existence. It is a tool that provides awareness & degrees of freedom to create systems with various scopes.

[Human](./src/human.md) [Beings](./src/being.md) can [focus](./src/focus.md) on a finite amount of complexity which is much less than the scope of Existence. This means humans must utilize abstractions to create systems that can be focused upon, lest the human becomes overwhelmed and not effective.

You can zoom in & out of the [system](./system.md) to observe details & [patterns](./src/pattern.md).

## Awareness of [Story](./src/story.md)

Stories are the proverbial "double-edged sword". Stories can illuminate [truth](./src/truth.md) & expand consciousness of an abstraction. Stories can also restrict the scope of an abstraction.

Since stories are [stateful](./src/state.md),

This philosophy makes judicious use of story in the pursuit of expanding consciousness.
