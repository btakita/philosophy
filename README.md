philosophy
==========

[This philosophy](./src/this-philosophy.md) is a [worldview](./src/worldview.md) [tool](./src/tool.md), with the intent of [expanding consciousness](./expanding-consciousness.md) by creating [novelty](./novelty.md) by connecting [abstractions](./abstraction.md). Expanding the [scope](./src/scope.md) of words facilitates connections between [entities](./src/entity.md) in [Existence](./src/existence.md) or [God](./src/god.md). This philosophy utilizes techniques, resources, & [edge effects](./src/edge-effects.md) from the [domains](./src/domain.md) of [science](./src/science.md), [spirituality](./src/spirituality.md), philosophy, logic, engineering, mathematics, etc.

## Similarities to other Fields

### [Language Planning](./src/language-planning.md)

This Philosophy utilizes Language Planning with the purpose of facilitating connections to Expand Consciousness.

### [Category Theory](./src/category-theory.md)

[Abstractions](./src/abstraction.md) are categories and [scopes](./src/scope.md) are morphisms. Connections between abstractions are also morphisms.

### [Linguistic Relativity](./src/linguistic-relativity.md) & [Evolutionary Linguistics](./src/evolutionary-linguistics.md)

[Evolution](./src/evolution.md) implies a creative activity. This Philosophy favors using & evolving existing words, by expanding scope, over creating new terminology. The worldview perspective facilitates connection between abstractions among different domains & worldviews.

### [Philosophy of Language](./src/philosophy-of-language.md)

## [Scope](./src/scope.md) & [Resolution](./src/resolution.md)

Since scope of this Philosophy is Existence/God, the resolution starts low. <a href="http://cosmicscale.appspot.com/index.html" target="_blank">
The Cosmic Scale</a> is a demonstration of scope (at different scales) in the [physical universe](./src/physical-system.md).

This philosophy defines abstractions in relation to Existence. Words, when applied to narrower scopes (than Existence), have different meanings. It is a tool that provides [awareness](./src/awareness.md) & degrees of freedom to create systems with various scopes.

[Human](./src/human.md) [Beings](./src/being.md) can [focus](./src/focus.md) on a finite amount of complexity which is much less than the scope of Existence. This means humans must utilize abstractions to create systems that can be focused upon, lest the human becomes overwhelmed and not effective.

You can zoom in & out of the [system](./system.md) to observe details & [patterns](./src/pattern.md).

## [Awareness](./src/awareness.md) of [Story](./src/story.md)

Stories can illuminate [truth](./src/truth.md) & expand consciousness of an abstraction. Stories can also restrict the scope of an abstraction. Stories are used to make an entity focus on a scope.

Since stories can set context and contexts set scope, a story may change the scope of focus of an entity.

This philosophy makes judicious use of story in the pursuit of expanding consciousness.
