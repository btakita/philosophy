philosophy
==========

A [Perspective](./perspective.md) on [Existence](./existence.md) or [God](./god.md).

## Goals

This philosophy seeks to define words as [abstractions](./abstraction.md). These [scope](./scope.md) of these abstractions are broadened to apply, with proper [context](./context.md), to any [entity](./entity.md) in existence.

## [Scope](./scope.md) & [Resolution](./resolution.md)

Since scope of this Philosophy is Existence/God, the resolution tends to be low. More detail can be referenced with outbound links.
