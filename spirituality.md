Spirituality is the way of expanding consciousness, or taking the perspective of God. It is the evolution of a being to expanded consciousness.

The term Spirituality evolves quickly. It relates to blissful transformation which is the evolution of a soul. When one has a "spiritual experience", the soul evolves into a state that is closer to existential understanding. Of experiencing consciousness expanding.

Most often, we relate certain activities to activating spiritual experiences. Singular events, like a moment of love, prayer, near death experiences, visions, dreams, an inspired montague are portrayed to us in literature & mass media to form our definition of a spiritual experience.

Spirituality is often accompanied with a zen feeling of peace. A being in "the zone". The breakthrough. The sun parting the storm clouds. The dissolution of the current state of ego into awareness we are a part of something greater.
